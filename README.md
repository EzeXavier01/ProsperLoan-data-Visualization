## Summary of Findings

> When I explored the income range, I found out that those with a higher income range do have a better rate or APR. The relationship between income range and borrower APR shows that the higher income range the lower APR. There are other values such as zero(0) which are not really an income range and also there is also "Not employed" which has the highest APR.For the employment status, the result of my analysis showed that people who are employed have a lower rate.
My findings also showed that people who are home owner also receive lower rates compared to those who don't have.
There seems to be a strong correlation between the credit_scorerange_upper and credit_scorerange_lower against the Prosper Score.
